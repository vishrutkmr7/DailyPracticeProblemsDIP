"""
Given the reference to the root of a binary tree, and a target value,
remove all the leaf nodes that contain the target and return the modified tree.
Note: If you remove a leaf node that contains the target value and the parent node
now becomes a leaf with a value of target, you must remove the parent as well. 

Ex: Given the following binary tree and targetâ€¦

      1
     / \
    2   3
   /
  2, target = 2, return the tree modified as follows...
       1
        \
         3
