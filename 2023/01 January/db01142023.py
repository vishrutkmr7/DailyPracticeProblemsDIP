"""Given a string s and an integer array, indices, you must rearrange s according to the given indices.
Once you have rearranged s successfully, the ith character in s should now be located at the indices[i]
index.
Note: s and indices will always be the same length. 

Ex: Given the following s and indicesâ€¦

s = "abc", indices = [2, 1, 0], return "cba" ('a' moves to the 2nd index, b stays at the first index,
and c moves to the zeroth index).
