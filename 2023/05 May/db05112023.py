"""
Given an array of integers, nums, and an integer, k, return the least number of unique numbers
left in nums after removing k elements.
Note: At least one integer will exist in nums and k will always be between zero and nums.length.

Ex: Given the following nums and kâ€¦

nums = [1, 4, 3, 3], k = 2, return 1 (remove 1 and 4 and only one unique integer is left which is 3).
