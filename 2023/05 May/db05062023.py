"""
Given an encoded string, s, return its decoded representation. The string s will be encoded
as follows N[letters], meaning that the letters should be repeated N times in the decoded
representation.
Note: You may assume s always encoded correctly (i.e. correct formatting of brackets, only
positive values outside the brackets, and always lowercase alphabetical characters inside the
brackets).

Ex: Given the following string sâ€¦

s = "3[a]2[b]1[c]", return "aaabbc" ("a" is repeated 3 times, "b" is repeated 2 times, and "c"
is repeated 1 time).
