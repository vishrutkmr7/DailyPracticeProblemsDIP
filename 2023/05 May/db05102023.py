"""
Given a string s and an integer k, return the length of the longest substring in s you can
create that contains a single capital letter. You may apply k operations to s where a single
operation consists of selecting one capital letter and modifying it to be another capital
letter.
Note: s will only contain uppercase alphabetical characters.

Ex: Given the following s and kâ€¦

s = "BBAA", k = 2, return 4 (both B's can be changed to A's or both A's can be changed to B's).
