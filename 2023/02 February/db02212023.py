Given an array of words and a string of characters, chars, return the sum of the lengths of words that can be formed
using only the chars.
Note: Each character within chars can only be used once.

Ex: Given the following words and charsâ€¦

words = ["abc", "cab"], chars = "bac", return 6 ("abc"'s length + "cab"'s length).
