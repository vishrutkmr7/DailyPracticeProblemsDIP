This question is asked by Google.
You are given a bag of coins, an initial energy of E,
and want to maximize your number of points (which starts at zero).
To gain a single point you can exchange coins[i] amount of energy
(i.e. if I have 100 energy and a coin that has a value 50 I can exchange 50 energy to gain a point).
If you do not have enough energy you can give away a point in exchange for an increase in energy by coins[i] amount
(i.e. you give away a point and your energy is increased by the value of that coin: energy += coins[i]).
Return the maximum number of points you can gain. 
Note: Each coin may only be used once.

Ex: Given the following coins and starting energyâ€¦

coins = [100, 150, 200] and E = 150, return 1
coins = [100,200,300,400] and E = 200, return 2
coins = [300] and E = 200, return 0

class Solution:
    def ship(self, coins, E):
        coins.sort()

        hi = len(coins) - 1
        points = 0
        while lo <= hi:
            if coins[lo] + coins[hi] <= E:
                lo += 1
            hi -= 1
            points += 1
        return points
