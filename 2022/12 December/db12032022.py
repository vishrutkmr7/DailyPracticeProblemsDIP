You are a thief trying to steal from houses in a neighborhood. The amount of money that can be
stolen from the ith house is represented by nums[i]. While youâ€™d like to steal from all the houses,
if adjacent houses are broken into, the police are notified via a security system. Return the
largest amount of money you can steal without alerting the police.
Note: You may not modify nums. Ex: Given the following nums...

nums = [1, 3, 2, 5, 2], return 8.
