Given the reference to a binary search tree and a value to insert,
return a reference to the root of the tree after the value has been inserted in a position
that adheres to the invariants of a binary search tree.
Note: It is guaranteed that each value in the tree, including the value to be inserted, is unique.

Ex: Given the following tree and valueâ€¦

      2
     / \
    1   3
value = 4, return the following tree...
      2
     / \
