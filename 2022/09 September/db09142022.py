"""
Given an integer N, return the total number self divisible numbers that are strictly less than N (starting from one).
Note: A self divisible number if a number that is divisible by all of its digits.

Ex: Given the following value of Nâ€¦

N = 17, return 12 because 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15 are all self divisible numbers.
