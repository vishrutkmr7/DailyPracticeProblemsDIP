This question is asked by Facebook.
Given an array of unsorted integers, return the length of its longest increasing subsequence.
Note: You may assume the array will only contain positive numbers.

Ex: Given the following array numsâ€¦

nums = [1, 9, 7, 4, 7, 13], return 4.
The longest increasing subsequence is 1, 4, 7, 13.
