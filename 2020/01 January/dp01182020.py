# This problem was recently asked by Amazon:

# Given a non-negative integer n, convert the integer to hexadecimal and return the result as a string.
# Hexadecimal is a base 16 representation of a number, where the digits are 0123456789ABCDEF. Do not use any builtin base conversion functions like hex.


def to_hex(n):
    # Fill this in.
    x = n % 16
    digits = "0123456789ABCDEF"
    rest = n // 16
    return digits[x] if rest == 0 else to_hex(rest) + digits[x]


print(to_hex(123))
# 7B
