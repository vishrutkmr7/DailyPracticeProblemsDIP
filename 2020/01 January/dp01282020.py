# This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

# Given two binary numbers represented as strings, return the sum of the two binary numbers as a new binary represented as a string.
# Do this without converting the whole binary string into an integer.


def sum_binary(bin1, bin2):
    # Fill this in.
    max_len = max(len(bin1), len(bin2))

    bin1 = bin1.zfill(max_len)
    bin2 = bin2.zfill(max_len)
    result = ""
    carry = 0

    for i in range(max_len - 1, -1, -1):
        r = carry
        r += 1 if bin1[i] == "1" else 0
        r += 1 if bin2[i] == "1" else 0
        result = ("1" if r % 2 == 1 else "0") + result
        carry = 0 if r < 2 else 1

    if carry != 0:
        result = f"1{result}"

    return result.zfill(max_len)


print(sum_binary("11101", "1011"))
# 101000
