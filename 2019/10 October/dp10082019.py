# This problem was recently asked by Facebook:

# Two words can be 'chained' if the last character of the first word is the same as the first character of the second word.

# Given a list of words, determine if there is a way to 'chain' all the words in a circle.
# Input: ['eggs', 'karat', 'apple', 'snack', 'tuna']
# Output: True
# Explanation:
# The words in the order of ['apple', 'eggs', 'snack', 'karat', 'tuna'] creates a circle of chained words.
