# This problem was recently asked by LinkedIn:

# Given a 2-dimensional grid consisting of 1's (land blocks) and 0's (water blocks), count the number of islands present in the grid.
# The definition of an island is as follows:
# 1.) Must be surrounded by water blocks.
# 2.) Consists of land blocks (1's) connected to adjacent land blocks (either vertically or horizontally).
# Assume all edges outside of the grid are water.
